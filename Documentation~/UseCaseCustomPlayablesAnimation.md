# Use case: Use Playables API for animation

> [!CAUTION]
> This feature is obsolete!

This use case was added in a previous version but has since been removed. It was not functioning correctly in builds due to the way animations are imported at runtime rather than in the editor. It is recommended to use legacy animation clips instead.

Please refer to the following note copied from the [AnimationClip.SetCurve](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/AnimationClip.SetCurve.html) documentation:

> [!NOTE]
> `SetCurve` will only work at runtime for legacy animation clips. For non-legacy AnimationClips it is an editor-only function.
