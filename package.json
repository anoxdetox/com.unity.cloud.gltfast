    "changelog": "### Added\n- (Import) Setting to create textures readable. This allows users to access resulting textures from their scripts.\n- (Export) Non-readable meshes can be exported as well now.\n- (Export) Added support for exporting meshes with vertex compression enabled (effectively converting 16-bit float positions/normals/tangents/texture coordinates to 32-bit floats).\n- (Export) [Buffer view targets](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#_bufferview_target) are set properly now.\n- (Import) Support for mesh primitive modes `TRIANGLE_STRIP` and `TRIANGLE_FAN` (thanks [Hexer611][Hexer611] for [#22](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.cloud.gltfast/pull/22))\n\n### Fixed\n- (Export) Writing to files on the web via IndexedDB now works (fixes [#625](https://github.com/atteneder/glTFast/issues/625))\n- (Export) test results are validated again.\n- (Export) Removed expendable JSON content when exporting unlit materials without color or texture applied.\n- Primitve mode LINE_LOOP works as expected (thanks [Hexer611][Hexer611] for [#22](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.cloud.gltfast/pull/22)).\n- (Test) Fail export test if glTF JSON contains unexpected or misses expected properties.\n- Increased resilience against invalid animation data.\n- Broken link in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (thanks [Hexer611][Hexer611] for [#22](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.cloud.gltfast/pull/23)).\n- Loading glTFs with unknown texture extensions (e.g. WebP, `EXT_texture_webp`) now works (fixes [#705](https://github.com/atteneder/glTFast/issues/705))."
