    "changelog": "### Added\n- Graphics Tests.\n- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) for keeping a consistent code-style.\n- [IBufferView.ByteStride](xref:GLTFast.Schema.IBufferView.ByteStride).\n\n### Changed\n- (CI) Consolidated multiple redundant packaging and vetting/API validation jobs.\n- Changed internal buffer representation to custom native collection `ReadOnlyBuffer<byte>` (instead of [NativeArray&lt;byte&gt;.ReadOnly](xref:Unity.Collections.NativeArray`1.ReadOnly)) This enables sub-array slicing, has in-Editor safety checks and prepares for decommissioning misuse of NativeSlice.\n- Bumped Burst dependency version to 1.8.24, which is the recommended version in 2021 xLTS.\n- [KTX for Unity] minimum required version was raised to 3.5.0.\n- [Draco for Unity] minimum required version was raised to 5.2.0.\n\n### Fixed\n- (Export) Spotlight's inner cone angle is exported correctly on HDRP now.\n- (Test) Disabled URP compatibility mode in URP presets as it's obsolete and unsupported from Unity 6.3 onward.\n- (Import) Spotlight's inner cone angle is imported correctly on HDRP now.\n\n### Removed\n- (CI) SonarQube scan job.\n\n### Deprecated\n- [GLTFast.ManagedNativeArray](xref:GLTFast.ManagedNativeArray`2). It will be removed from public API in a future release. For internal development it's been replaced by `ReadOnlyBufferManagedArray<T>`.\n- [GLTFast.Export.ManagedNativeArray](xref:GLTFast.Export.ManagedNativeArray`2). It will get sealed or removed from public API in a future release.\n- [IGltfReadable.GetAccessorData](xref:GLTFast.IGltfReadable.GetAccessorData(System.Int32)). Along with [IGltfReadable.GetAccessor](xref:GLTFast.IGltfReadable.GetAccessor(System.Int32)) it is going to be removed and replaced with an improved way to access accessors' data in a future release.\n\n### Security"
