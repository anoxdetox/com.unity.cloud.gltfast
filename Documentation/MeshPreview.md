# glTFast Mesh Preview Enhancement

This feature fixes the mesh preview issue where glTFast submeshes would not display properly in Unity's Inspector.

## Problem

Previously, when clicking on the root glTF asset, the mesh would display properly in the Inspector preview. However, when clicking on individual submeshes imported by glTFast, the mesh preview area would be empty, making it difficult to inspect individual meshes.

## Solution

The `GltfMeshInspector` provides a custom mesh inspector specifically for meshes imported by glTFast that:

1. **Detects glTF Meshes**: Automatically identifies when a mesh was imported by glTFast
2. **Provides Preview Functionality**: Integrates Unity's `MeshPreview` system for glTF submeshes
3. **Maintains Compatibility**: Falls back to Unity's built-in inspector for non-glTF meshes
4. **Enhanced Information Display**: Shows glTF-specific mesh information

## Features

### Mesh Preview Functionality
- **Interactive 3D Preview**: Full 3D mesh preview with rotation, zoom, and lighting controls
- **Multiple Display Modes**: Shaded, UV Checker, UV Layout, Vertex Color, Normals, Tangents, Blend Shapes
- **LOD Support**: Preview different LOD levels if available
- **UV Channel Selection**: Browse different UV channels
- **Wireframe Toggle**: Show/hide wireframe overlay

### Enhanced Inspector Information
- **Mesh Statistics**: Vertices, triangles, submesh count
- **LOD Information**: Display LOD levels if generated
- **Blend Shape Count**: Show available blend shapes
- **Vertex Attributes**: List all vertex attributes with format information
- **Bounds Information**: Mesh bounding box center and size
- **Read/Write Status**: Show whether mesh is readable
- **Import Source Indicator**: Clear indication that mesh was imported via glTFast

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The solution uses a two-part architecture:

1. **GltfMeshPreviewIntegration**: Static class that manages mesh preview instances
   - Tracks selection changes
   - Creates/destroys preview instances as needed
   - Synchronizes preview settings across multiple meshes
   - Automatically detects glTF-imported meshes

2. **GltfMeshInspector**: Custom editor that replaces Unity's default mesh inspector
   - Detects whether a mesh was imported by glTFast
   - Provides preview functionality for glTF meshes
   - Falls back to Unity's built-in inspector for other meshes
   - Displays enhanced mesh information

### Key Technical Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Uses `AssetImporter.GetAtPath()` to detect glTF import source
- **Memory Management**: Properly disposes of preview instances when no longer needed
- **Selection Tracking**: Responds to selection changes to optimize resource usage
- **Preview Synchronization**: Keeps preview settings synchronized across multiple mesh selections
- **Fallback Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrates with Unity's existing mesh inspection system

### Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Preview instances are created only when needed
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Unused previews are disposed when selection changes
- **Resource Sharing**: Preview settings are synchronized to reduce redundant operations

## Usage

No additional setup is required. The enhanced mesh preview functionality is automatically available for all meshes imported via glTFast:

1. **Import a glTF/glb file** using the glTFast importer
2. **Navigate to the submeshes** in the Project window
3. **Select any mesh** to see the enhanced preview in the Inspector
4. **Use the preview controls** in the Inspector preview area:
   - **Mouse drag**: Rotate the mesh
   - **Right mouse drag**: Adjust lighting
   - **Scroll wheel**: Zoom in/out
   - **Middle mouse drag**: Pan the view
   - **Preview toolbar**: Change display modes, UV channels, LOD levels

## Compatibility

- **Unity Version**: Compatible with Unity 2021.3 and later
- **Render Pipelines**: Works with Built-in, URP, and HDRP
- **Platform**: All platforms supported by Unity Editor
- **glTF Features**: Supports all mesh features including LODs, blend shapes, and multiple UV sets

## Benefits

1. **Improved Workflow**: Developers can now properly inspect glTF submeshes
2. **Better Debugging**: Visual mesh inspection helps identify import issues
3. **Quality Assurance**: Easy verification of mesh topology, UVs, and normals
4. **LOD Verification**: Visual confirmation of LOD generation results
5. **Performance Analysis**: Quick assessment of mesh complexity and vertex attributes

## Integration with LOD Generation

This mesh preview enhancement works seamlessly with the LOD generation feature:

- **LOD Visualization**: Use the LOD slider to preview different detail levels
- **LOD Information**: Inspector shows the number of available LOD levels
- **LOD Statistics**: Vertex and triangle counts adjust based on selected LOD level
- **Interactive Preview**: Rotate and examine meshes at different LOD levels

## Technical Notes

### Editor Integration
- Uses Unity's `[CustomEditor]` attribute to override default mesh inspection
- Leverages Unity's built-in `MeshPreview` class for consistent behavior
- Implements proper resource management with `IDisposable` patterns

### Memory Management
- Previews are automatically disposed when no longer needed
- Selection change events trigger cleanup of unused instances
- Proper handling of Unity Editor lifecycle events

### Fallback Behavior
- Non-glTF meshes continue to use Unity's default inspector
- Graceful degradation if preview functionality is unavailable
- Compatible with Unity's existing mesh editing workflows
